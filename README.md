# Thread-safe-Binary-Search-Tree

C# project - Introduction to operating systems course.

Binary search tree (BST) is an elementary data structure in computer science in which the value in a node is greater than all the values in the node's left subtree and less than those in its right subtree.

This project was done as part of the “Introduction to operating systems course”.
The aim of the project is to  implement 
a Binary Search Tree (BST) class that can be called from multiple threaded concurrently, and hence, need to be implement synchronization correctly.
